							<h1>Sauron</h1>
							<h2>(HackPSU AI and Overall Best Hack Winner, April 2022)</h2>
							<p>Sauron is a data pipeline for the collection and distribution 
								of information about humanitarian crises in real time It uses 
								computer vision (security cameras, satellite imagery, etc.), 
								to upload the locations of dangerous events to a map in real time. 
								As a minimum viable product, our team built out the infrastructure 
								required for data collection from two sources; real-time traffic 
								camera feeds and an app that allowed users to upload images manually 
								(they would then be automatically geotagged and displayed). After 
								22 hours of work and 2 hours of sleep (thankfully) we won 
								the best overall hack prize, as well as the Nittany Ai prize for best 
								hack that utilized artificial intelligence. 
								A demonstration of the system is shown below.</p>
