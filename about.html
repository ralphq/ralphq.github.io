							<p>Hi! I'm Ralph Quartiano. I'm originally from Long Island NY, and lived there until I went to Penn State University. At PSU I got a B.S. in
							Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis on autonomous vehicles. I now live in Pittsburgh and work at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering 
							Institute doing research on edge computer vision for the Department of Defense. I'm also pursuing an M.S. in Computer Science with a focus on perception & robotics at Georgia Tech 
							part-time. In my free time I love staying active through weightlifting and Muay Thai, reading nonfiction books, and going out with friends.
							</p>
							<p>Aside from getting more experience and education, my main career goal is to continue developing innovative technologes for national security.
								More specifically, I have worked hard to position myself at the intersection of aerospace engineering and artificial intelligence because I believe both
								will continue to have profound economic and geopolitical effects on our country in the coming years.
							</p>
