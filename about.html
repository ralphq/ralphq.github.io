							<p>Hi! I'm Ralph Quartiano. I'm originally from Long Island NY, and lived there until I went to Penn State University. At PSU I got a B.S. in
							Aerospace Engineering with an emphasis on autonomous vehicles. I now live in Pittsburgh and work at the Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering 
							Institute doing research on edge computer vision.</p>
							<p>In my free time I love staying active through weightlifting and Muay Thai, reading nonfiction books, and going out with friends. Since
								graduating I've also tried to continue my education by building cool stuff and completing online courses, both of which you can see in the 
								Personal Projects section.
							</p>
							<p>My current goals are to go to graduate school part-time, travel whenever I can, and gain more experience both at work and on my own.
								I'm always looking for opportunies to work with awesome people on exciting things, and can't wait to see what the future holds!
							</p>
