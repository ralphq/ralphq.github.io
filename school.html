							<h1>School Projects</h1>
							<h2>Aerospace Engineering at Penn State</h2>
							<p>This page is a collection of some of my favorite projects in undergrad.
								I've included a description the project, the class it was for, and images/videos
								where appropriate for each.
							</p>
							<h3>AERSP 424, Advanced Computer Programming in C++</h3>
							<p>For our final project, my group and I created a gimbal-mounted “sentry tower” 
								that would track a target based on color recognition. We got experience implementing 
								our C++ code with third party software (namely OpenCV) and interfacing said 
								software with custom hardware. Shown below is our gimbal mounted camera completing a 
								full field of view sweep to initially detect the target.</p>

							<h3>AERSP 304, System Dynamics & Controls <a href="website_media/Final-Report.pdf" style="color: #77C3EC;">(Final Report)</a></h3>
							<p>Integrating the dynamics modelling skills we’d acquired in the first half of this 
								course with the closed-loop control system design skills we’d acquired in the second 
								(in this case the root locus method), this project asked us to simulate and ultimately 
								improve the performance of a quadrotor drone attempting to follow a given trajectory. 
								Shown below on the left is a root locus plot showing how the addition of a lag 
								compensator affects the system by pole placement, and on the right is the corresponding 
								step response.</p>

							<h3>AERSP 304, System Dynamics & Controls <a href="website_media/304_Project__1_Report.pdf" style="color: #77C3EC;">(Report 1)</a></h3>
							<p>This project tasked us with modelling the relative motion of celestial bodies, 
								specifically the “circular restricted three body problem.” It heavily involved our 
								knowledge of rotational body kinematics, orbital mechanics, and differential equation 
								approximation techniques. Shown below are orbit trajectories of a satellite about the “Earth-Moon 
								L2 & L4 Points.” These are two of the 5 points in space in which the gravitational forces of 
								the Earth & Moon are equal, and thus a spacecraft will stay at rest (a.k.a Lagrange points). 
								As shown below, orbits about L2 are unstable, meaning that they break down in the face of 
								disturbances and produce unpredictable behavior. Orbits about L4 are semi-stable, meaning that
								while they do not return to the original orbit exactly they do produce more predictable post-disturbance 
								behavior.</p>

							<h3>AERSP 313, Aerospace Analysis <a href="website_media/Team-30-Computer-Project-1-Final-Report.pdf" style="color: #77C3EC;">(Report 1)</a></h3>
							<p>This project tasked us with the approximation and modeling of quadrotor drone dynamics, both 
								analytically and numerically. Being one of my first projects in aerospace, it was an awesome 
								introduction to how the calculus and linear algebra skills we’d acquired in our freshman and sophomore 
								years would be used going forward. The assigned analytical method was the Laplace transform, which 
								although I didn’t know it yet would soon become essential to my favorite area of aerospace: control 
								systems. The assigned numerical method was the Runge-Kutta method, which is an effective state-space 
								representation based approximation technique for higher order differential equation systems. This method 
								is used very commonly in industry, a well-known example being the ode45 function approximator in MATLAB.</p>
