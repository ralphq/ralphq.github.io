							<h1>Student Training Program</h1>
							<h2>Student Space Programs Lab (SSPL)</h2>
							<p>For this training program, students were put in teams of 3 and tasked 
								with the design, manufacture, testing, and actual launch of a telemetry 
								payload for model rockets. I designed and manufactured the payload housing, 
								which served as my introduction to Solidworks, selected & purchased 
								electronic components, and soldered said components to an Arduino 
								microcontroller. Using an IMU, altimeter, and even a pressure sensor our team 
								was able to fuse the data into a continuous flight trajectory which we 
								presented to other teams at the end of the program. Also, after completing the
								program itself my team and I were instructors for the next two semesters. 
								Our launch is shown below!</p>
