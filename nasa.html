							<h1>Project Manager & Systems Engineer</h1>
							<h2><a href="https://bigidea.nianet.org/past-competition-themes/2020-competition/">Oasis: 2020 NASA BIG Idea Challenge Finalist</a></h2>
							<p>Working in the Student Space Programs Laboratory (SSPL), myself and 19 other 
								students were tasked with the development of a Laser Induced Breakdown 
								Spectroscopy (LIBS) system for use at the Moon’s southern pole. LIBS works by 
								exciting electrons in a sample and detected the wavelengths of photons emitted 
								by the sample as said electrons return to normal energy levels; it is a reliable 
								spectroscopy technique previously used commercially and for space exploration, 
								the most famous example being ChemCam, which flew on NASA’s Curiosity rover. The 
								project, named Oasis since it was searching for water, received roughly $150,000 
								of US funding for the development & integration of the following technologies:</p>
								
								<ul>
									<li>Custom optics for laser focusing & spectra collection</li>
									<li>Flight computer & PCB for data transmission & power distribution</li>
									<li>Thermal control system for component temperature regulation</li>
									<li>Vibration-withstanding payload housing & mount</li>
								</ul>
								
								<p>As the project manager & systems engineer for the project, I learned so much 
								in that project not only about the design, manufacturing, and verification of 
								complex aerospace systems, but also leadership, organization, public speaking, 
								and working with others. I've linked our proof of concept presentation below and final report 
								<a href="website_media/2020-BIG-Idea-Technical-Paper_Penn-State.pdf">here</a>.</p>
