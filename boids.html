							<h2>Simulation of Bird Flocking Behavior</h2>
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>Boids Algorithm (a.k.a Reynolds Flocking) is an artificial life program 
								created to simulate the flocking behavior of birds. Originally published in a 1986 computer
								graphics conference, Boids has historically been used for realistic "looking" behavior
								in animation and video game development. However, this algorithm is a classic example
								of agent-based modelling, which underpins many modern autonomy engineering techniques
								(dynamical systems modelling, reinforcement learning, swarm robotics, etc). Agent-based modelling techniques 
								are based on the idea of emergent behavior, which is defined as "when a complex 
								entity has properties or behaviors that its parts do not have on their own, and 
								emerge only when they interact in a wider whole." Given how epitomic an example of this concept 
								Boids is, I thought it'd be interesting to implement it myself.
							<h3>Implementation</h3>
							<p>
								Boids algorithm has three simple rules:
							</p>
								<img src="website_media/boids_screenshot.png" style="padding-bottom: 32px; max-width: 66%; align-self: center;"/>
							<p>
								The simulation is initialized with a user-specified number of agents in random positions and headings.
								At each time step, a loop applies each of these rules to each agent, setting a weighted sum of the headings (called
								target vectors in the code) returned by each rule as the new heading. Once a new heading has been calculated for each
								agent, the simulation takes one time step forward with agents flying in their new heading at a predetermined,
								constant speed. This process repeats over the length of the simulation, which is rendered in a pygame window.

							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><em>Loop structure is important and requires some foresight.</em> This project's git history shows some inefficient nesting, redundant calculations,
									and worst of all loops that shouldn't exist at all. Refining/removing these over time was a great exercise, but thinking about them more ahead
									of time would've definitely saved some.
								</li>
								<li><em>Don't underestimate the amount of necessary implementation decisions, even for a very simple algorithm.</em> 
									Does "local" mean within some radius or k-nearest-neighbors?
									Do I treat distance as a threshold (local/nonlocal) or continuous value?
									How should I tune commands from rules against one another? Are there additional rules I should implement, like edge avoidance?
									While these variations are still "boids algorithm," they can significantly impact how the system behaves.
