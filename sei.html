							<h1>Software Engineer for Advanced Computing (AI Division)</h1>
							<h2><a href="https://www.sei.cmu.edu/about/divisions/artificial-intelligence-division/">Carnegie Mellon Software Engineering Institute (SEI)</a></h2>
							<p>Currently I'm a full-time researcher in the SEI AI Division's 
								Advanced Computing Lab (ACL). The ACL combines novel
								hardware (FPGAs, quantum computers, analog computers, etc) with
								AI technologies to solve national security problems. My work 
								focuses the implementation of machine learning algorithms on 
								extremely low size, weight, and power (low-SWaP) platforms, often
								referred to as edge computing. The ability to run computer vision, signal
								intelligence, or even large language models 'at the edge' rather than
								on a distant server can increase these models' speed, and security in 
								mission-critical environments.</p>
							<p>I actually started this position as a part-time intern in college and loved
								it so much I came back full-time. As state-of-the-art AI techniques become
								more and more resource intensive hardware will become a more and more important
								factor. Many believe this process has already begun, with the <a href="https://builtin.com/hardware/moores-law">'death of Moore's
								Law'</a> leading to more research in specialized and heterogenous computing.
							</p>
							<p>I've included the ACL's annual research review for a project I directly worked on below.</p>
