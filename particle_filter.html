							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p>In this project, I successfully implemented a particle filter to localize a 
								satellite in an unknown position within a solar system. The challenge was to determine the satellite's 
								position using only noisy gravitational acceleration measurements from surrounding planets. 
								The satellite followed an approximately circular orbit around the sun, and I had 300 days 
								(simulation time) and 15 seconds (CPU time) to accurately estimate its position before resources ran out.</p>
							<h3>Implementation</h3>
							<p><i>Note: To preserve the integrity of their assignments, the GT OMSCS program asks its students not to share their code
								online. However, I am freely able to describe my approach.
							</i></p>
							<p>
								Implementing a particle filter for the aforementioned purposes mainly included the following steps
									<ul>
										<li><i>Initialization:</i> A set of particles was distributed across a plausible search area within the solar system. In my case, this was uniformly about the solar system but with 
										logical orientations for a counterclockwise orbit (we're told ahead of time that all orbits are in that direction).</li>
										<li><i>Weighting:</i> Each particle’s weight was updated based on how closely its predicted reading matched the observed 
											measurement. A Gaussian probability density function was used to determine the likelihood of each particle’s 
											estimate, incorporating the measurement noise. Particles that produced predictions closer to the observed data were 
											assigned higher weights, while those with large discrepancies had their weights reduced. This ensured that the most 
											probable particles were reinforced during the resampling process, improving the accuracy of the filter over time.</li>
										<li><i>Resampling:</i> A probabilistic resampling step was used to reinforce likely locations and eliminate unlikely ones.</li>
										<li><i>Motion Model:</i> The particles were updated according to a bicycle motion model, approximating the satellite's circular orbit.</li>
										<li><i>Fuzzing (Jittering):</i> A small percentage of particles were randomly perturbed to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence.</li>
										<li><i>Estimation:</i> The final location was determined by averaging the most probable particles.</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</p>
							<h3>Takeaways</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><i>The Power of Fuzzing:</i> Fuzzing techniques are effective in preventing sample impoverishment by maintaining particle diversity after resampling, 
									ensuring the filter continues to represent uncertainty accurately. By introducing controlled random perturbations to resampled particles, 
									roughening prevents the collapse of the particle set into overly concentrated clusters, allowing the filter to maintain coverage of potential locations. 
									Determing the right amount to fuzz is essential to strike a balance—excessive roughening can blur the distribution and reduce accuracy, while 
									insufficient roughening may lead to premature convergence and loss of viable hypotheses.
								<li><i>Computational Trade-offs:</i> Increasing particle count improves accuracy but risks exceeding time constraints, requiring an optimized balance. Techniques
								like varying the sigma of the resampling wheel's gaussian and fuzzing can help get the most "bang for your particle." Tuning these different parameters was a very
								interesting process.</li>
