							<h1>Autonomy & AI Engineer</h1>
							<h2><a href="https://palski.com/">Palski & Associates</a></h2>
							<p>Palski & Associates, a satellite engineering firm based in 
								Colorado Springs, CO, tasked our team of 4 interns with the 
								development of a simulation environment in which satellite agents 
								can be trained to pilot themselves autonomously with reinforcement learning. 
								To simulate military rendezvous-proximity operations (RPOs), each simulation 
								involved a team of up to three attacker spacecraft trying to reach a “flag” 
								guarded by up to three defender spacecraft, each of which acted independently from one another. 
							<p>This project introduced me to fundamental autonomy & Ai concepts like 
								Markov decision processes, deep learning, and state estimation. It was programmed in Julia, 
								a relatively new programming language perfect for this application because of its speed, power, 
								and extensive open-source packages in relevant areas.</p>
							<p>Visualized below is a simulation in which the defender immediately approaches the attacker, 
								only for the attacker to quickly evade once the defender gets too close. This high level 
								behavior and others like it emerged autonomously, and demonstrate that the agents were learning 
								novel strategies over many training simulations.</p>
